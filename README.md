Advanced Data Analysis App
This Shiny script creates an interactive **R-based web app** for advanced data analysis, allowing users to upload a dataset (CSV or Excel), choose variables, and run **statistical tests** 
(Shapiro-Wilk for normality, t-test, ANOVA) and **visualizations** (boxplots, scatterplots, regression, histograms, etc.). It dynamically adjusts the UI based on analysis type (single vs. 
comparative), renders data previews and plots, and lets users **download a report** summarizing the results. It's designed with a user-friendly layout and customizable graph labeling, ideal 
for researchers who need fast, flexible, and reproducible analysis without coding.
